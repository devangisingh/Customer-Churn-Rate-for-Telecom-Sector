# Customer Churn Rate for Telecom Sector

## Introduction
- Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is the process where customers stop doing business with a company or service.
- In the context of the telecom industry, customer churn refers to subscribers discontinuing their service with a telecom provider, either by switching to another provider or by stopping the service altogether.

- Reasons that may results for Churn:

   1. Customer Service: Poor customer service can lead to dissatisfaction and drive customers to switch providers.
   2. Competitive Offers: Competitors offering better pricing, improved service quality, or attractive packages can lure customers away.
   3. Network Quality: Poor network coverage or frequent service disruptions can lead to customer dissatisfaction.
   4. Billing Issues: Inaccurate billing or perceived overcharging can prompt customers to leave.
   5. Technological Advancements: Customers may switch to providers offering the latest technology (e.g., 5G services).

- Statistics and Facts:

   1. Churn Rate: The global average churn rate for telecom companies ranges from 1.5% to 3% per month. This means that annually, 18% to 36% of customers may leave.
   2. Cost of Churn: It is estimated that acquiring a new customer can cost 5 to 25 times more than retaining an existing one. For telecom companies, this underscores the importance of minimizing churn.
   3. Customer Loyalty Programs: Many telecom companies implement loyalty programs to reduce churn. For instance, offering discounts, exclusive offers, or reward points can help retain customers.
